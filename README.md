achromenyms
===========

achromenyms is a small chrome extension that displays a tooltip when mouse is held over a set of initials on a webpage.
It was created to fulfill a personal necessity of the author and as a way to learn how to code simple chrome extensions.
It will work when a string of words is abbreviated as initials in the following way:
"Document Object Model (DOM)."
If that string is present, all occurances of the initials DOM will display a tooltip with their meaning.

Example
-------
In the example below, the pointer is over the word (DOM).
